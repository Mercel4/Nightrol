# Introduce

The **POTENTIAL PROJECT™ Integrity Module** is a proprietary system developed to ensure the security, fairness, and stability of the POTENTIAL PROJECT™ game environment. This module actively monitors and detects unauthorized modifications, tampering attempts, and any irregularities that could compromise gameplay integrity. By integrating this module, developers can safeguard against cheating, protect user data, and maintain a consistent experience across all game instances.

Designed with flexibility in mind, the module can be seamlessly integrated into the project with minimal effort — simply adding the provided script is sufficient for full functionality. The system is fundamentally based on **JSON**, and incorporates a robust **game data storage system**, **AES-based encryption**, and **checksum verification** to detect any data tampering. It continuously monitors data integrity at **50ms intervals**, while allowing legitimate data changes through exception handling mechanisms. Upon detecting unauthorized modifications, the module can trigger a scene transition, and developers can further customize the response logic as needed. Key features include real-time data alteration detection, critical file verification, and automated integrity violation responses, all rigorously tested to minimize performance impact while maintaining security and reliability.
